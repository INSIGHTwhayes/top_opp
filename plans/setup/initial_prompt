I am trying to set up a data schema for our consulting firm to easily find connections between ourselves and a prospective client. For our own internal data we have information around our current clients, private equity firms, and people. Most of our clients are companies that are owned by Private Equity. The trick to this is that companies can have different Private Equity owners throughout the year. People can move jobs, etc.

The prospective client we would research has very similar data. They would be owned by private equity, have a leadership team, etc. They would have former PE owners and former employees.

I am trying to structure this data in a way that we can easily find mutual connections between our current client relationships and the future prospective client. I am struggling because of the time nature of the problem with things changing. Can you please help me research a way to structure this data in such a way that we can compare the two datasets and find connections? A connection might be that a former employee of our current client is now working at the prospective client. A connection may be that one of our current private equity clients formerly owned the prospective client. The connections could be more tenuous with a previous employee of our client's used to be previously employeed at he prospective client. Etc.
